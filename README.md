# Performance Monitor [WIP]

A handy way to monitor your website performance, in a form of WordPress plugin.

Uses JavaScript [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API).

**Please, note:** This is a quick'n'dirty proof of concept. It works, shows some 
useful performance stats and even looks pretty neat (at least I believe so). But 
the implementation isn't ready for prime time yet.
